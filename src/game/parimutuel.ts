/**
 * Parimutuel settlement. The crowd sets the odds: winners split the whole Pot
 * pro-rata to their stake. No house, no fixed odds, no oracle for prices.
 *
 * Money is FROST (bigint), so this is exact integer arithmetic. Rounding dust
 * from integer division is handed back to winners deterministically so the sum
 * of payouts always reconciles to (grossPot - rake) to the last frost.
 *
 * Rake is taken only from the *losers'* pool, never from a winner's own stake —
 * a winner is always made at least whole.
