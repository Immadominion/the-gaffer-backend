 * natural language, queryable by relevance: "you chase losses", "you swore
 * Argentina were finished". It is written when notable events occur and read
 * before a bet, after a result, and whenever the Gaffer speaks. On Walrus this
 * is MemWal; in tests it is a local keyword index. Same contract either way.
